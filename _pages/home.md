### Welcome!

Hi, this is my official webpage that aims to inform you about my professional career history. 
First, this webpage shows information about my research topics, research interests, invited talks, peer-reviewed publications, student supervision history, and teaching experience. 
Additionally, this webpage also shows my software development project history, i.e., which software project I am previously or currently involved. 
I will also post some of my thoughts (including some off topic thoughts) in this website. Stay tuned!
